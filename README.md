# mvsas-debian-rr2640

A simple script &amp; patch to enable the RocketRAID 2640x4 to work with mvsas as a plain HBA.

I made this so I could use the RocketRAID 2640x4 (which is a pretty terrible RAID card) as a HBA for ZFS - which works pretty well.

This does NOT allow you to use any of the RAID functionality of the card.

**This has only been tested on Debian Stretch**
